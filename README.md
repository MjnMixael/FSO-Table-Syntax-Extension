# FreespaceOpen Table Syntax

`fso-table-syntax` is a Visual Studio Code extension providing syntax highlighting and embedded Lua support for FreespaceOpen table (`.tbl`, `.tbm`) and mission files (`.fc2`, `.fs2`). This extension makes working with FreespaceOpen configurations and scripts easier and more efficient by offering clean, intuitive highlighting tailored to the format.

## Features

- **Custom Syntax Highlighting**:
  - Supports sections (`#`), parent flags (`$`), child flags (`+`), and special flags like `@Laser`.
  - Highlights constants, operators, strings, and comments.

- **Embedded Lua Support**:
  - Lua code inside `$<flag>: [...]` blocks is highlighted and can integrate with the Lua language server for full functionality.

- **File Icon Support**:
  - Provides a custom file icon for `.tbl`, `.tbm`, `.fc2`, and `.fs2` files in the Explorer.

## Requirements

- **Lua Language Server (Optional)**:
  To enable advanced Lua functionality (e.g., IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Peek), install the [Sumneko Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) extension in VS Code.

---

## Extension Settings

This extension doesnâ€™t add custom settings but relies on your existing VS Code and Lua language server configurations. Ensure the Lua language server is set up for embedded Lua support.

---

## Known Issues

- **Lua Language Features**:
  Full Lua language server functionality inside embedded Lua blocks requires proper configuration. Refer to the "Requirements" section for details.
